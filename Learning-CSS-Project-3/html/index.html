        <p>This is a very simple series of pages that are used as a means of practicing HTML and CSS. 
          In particulary, I'm trying to practice with grids and the box model.</p>
        <p>There's nothing complicated here, but the links in the navigation bar 
        at the top will take you to a styled page displaying some pictures from two public domain websites. </p>
        <p>One of the websites, <em>The Gender Spectrum</em>, 
        shows some pictures of non-binary and trans folks. 
        The other, <em>Disabled and Here</em> shows some pictures and illustrations of folks with disabilities.</p>
